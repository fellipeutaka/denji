description: Remove all icons from your project
---

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Remove all icons from the project.

## Usage

```bash
denji clear [options]
```

## Options

### --yes

**Type:** `boolean`  
**Alias:** `-y`

Skip confirmation prompt.

```bash
denji clear --yes
```

## Examples

Clear with confirmation:
```bash
denji clear
```

Output:
```
? Are you sure you want to remove all icons? (y/N)
```

Clear without confirmation:
```bash
denji clear --yes
```

## How It Works

1. Shows confirmation prompt (unless `--yes` is used)
2. Removes all icons from icons file
3. Resets to empty template
4. Runs `postClear` hooks (if configured)

<Callout type="warn">
This action cannot be undone. Make sure to commit your changes before clearing.
</Callout>

## After Clearing

The icons file is reset to:

```tsx
export const Icons = {};
```

You can start fresh by adding new icons:

```bash
denji add lucide:check
```
